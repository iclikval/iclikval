# iCLiKVAL

iCLiKVAL is an easy-to-use web-based tool that uses the power of crowdsourcing to accumulate annotation information for all scientific literature and media (currently PubMed) found online. Annotations, such as keywords, make information easier to find and allow for much richer data searches. In iCLiKVAL, annotations are added to items as simple key-value (and optional relationship) tuples. Use it to annotate any article (try starting with your own), or join an interest group and work together to annotate literature related to the group topic.
